# Enhanced GitHub Actions for Your Project

I've prepared five essential GitHub Actions workflows to complement your existing CI/CD setup:

## 1. 🚀 Vercel Preview Deployments

File: .github/workflows/vercel-preview.yml

Automatically creates preview deployments for each PR, using Vercel instead of Netlify.

    Creates a unique URL for each PR: pr-{number}-propagation.vercel.app
    Builds your project with proper caching
    Requires you to add Vercel secrets to your repository

## 2. 🤖 PR Management System

File: .github/workflows/pr-manager.yml

A sophisticated PR management workflow that:

    Auto-labels PRs based on changed files using the labeler config
    Labels PRs by size (XS, S, M, L, XL) to encourage manageable changes
    Welcomes first-time contributors with a helpful message
    Warns when dependency files (package-lock.json) are modified

## 3. 📋 Issue Management System

File: .github/workflows/issue-manager.yml

Streamlines issue handling with features like:

    Automatic issue categorization using AI-based labeling
    French language detection for issues (adds a "🇫🇷 français" label)
    Project board integration to organize issues
    Stale issue handling that closes inactive issues after 40 days
    Welcomes new issue reporters with a bilingual message

## 4. 🇫🇷 French Text Validator

File: .github/workflows/french-validator.yml

Prevents encoding issues with French characters by:

    Checking all code files for unescaped French characters
    Providing detailed error reports showing file and line numbers
    Suggesting how to fix the issues using your existing script
    Only running when relevant files change (optimized for performance)

## 5. ⚙️ Configuration Files for Actions

Files:

    .github/labeler.yml: Configuration to automatically label PRs based on changed files
    .github/issue-labeler.yml: Rules for categorizing new issues by content

How These Enhance Your Workflow

These actions work together to create a fully automated development workflow:

    Quality Control: Ensures code meets standards (French validation, dependency checks)
    Rapid Feedback: Preview deployments for visual testing of changes
    Lower Maintenance: Automates mundane tasks like issue/PR organization
    Better Collaboration: Guides contributors and provides useful feedback
    Consistent Processing: Ensures issues and PRs are handled uniformly

Each action is carefully crafted to fit into your existing tools and development style, with special attention to your multilingual content needs.
